# Wesnoth 2017 campaigns

This repository serves as list of user-made SP campaigns for Battle for Wesnoth which were published in 2017 for the first time. I am going to use it to create a poll of best umc of 2017 on the official forums of the game but feel free to use this for anything else too. If I forget to add some campaign (and you want that to be listed), feel free to create an issue/pull request. For PRs, please follow the format seen below, for issues it is fine to include just the name of the campaign, I can gather other info myself (as long as the campaign is on the official add-ons server and/or has a thread on the officials forums).
